## IoT Mobile Application and Automatic Door Lock

This repository contains the development of an IoT project that collects information and interacts with the outside world through a mobile application. The main objective of this project is to create an automatic door lock that can be controlled by an Android app.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on the design, implementation, and operation of a network of devices connected through a TCP/IP communication architecture. These devices are capable of collecting information and interacting with the external environment. The project utilizes various technologies and concepts learned throughout the semester.

## Key Features
- Development of a mobile application using Android Studio to operate the IoT system.
- Implementation of an automatic door lock controlled by the Android app using Raspberry Pi as microprocessors.
- Utilization of the Scrum methodology for project management and development.
- Programming in Java for the Android application.
- Integration of Arduino devices for the IoT functionalities.
- Accessing inputs/outputs (GPIO, PWM, I2C, UART, etc.) for device interaction.
- Creation and integration of sensors, as well as signal conditioning.
- Utilization of cloud services for data storage and retrieval.
- Implementation of NoSQL databases for efficient data management.
- Exploration of different communication alternatives in the IoT domain.
- Deployment of the communication infrastructure using WiFi network.

## Methodology and Evaluation
The project follows a combined approach of CDIO and Scrum methodologies to ensure comprehensive engineering education and effective project management. The CDIO methodology provides a holistic framework for the project, guiding the development process from conception to operation. Then, the Scrum methodology has been adopted for project management, incorporating sprint planning, task management, and iterative development.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the development environment with Android Studio and Arduino.
3. Install the required dependencies and libraries.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to express our gratitude to the course instructors and the university for providing the opportunity to work on this project and gain practical experience in IoT development.
